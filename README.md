# Discord Ticket Bot

// EmrSahin Ticket Bot

**Setup**
The setup to this is a little bit complicated if you are not used to making or seeing Discord Bots or Javascript in code, the files currently are setup to my customization so you will need to change a lot of the messages.

**Features**
- Embed Messages
- Reaction to create a ticket
- Categories for the tickets
- Won't delete the channel when reslved so you can save any nessary details (optional)


**Support**
If you need help, join this Discord server:
[https://discord.gg/z6s4JsZwrj](https://discord.gg/z6s4JsZwrj)
Or...
Create an issue ticket, I can't guarantee I can always help you though because I'm not a very adavnced developer yet (I'm still learning).

**HOW TO SETUP MYSQL**
To setup the Mysql database, copy and paste the ``example.env`` file and re-name it to just ``.env``. then you can delete the ``example.env``. 
After just edit the ``.env`` file to your configurations. 

**How to Setup**

**FULL CREDIT GOES TO EmrSahin the Developer**

I'm not going to provide support on this, you can try contact me but this is just a fun project. I'm not going to develop it. 
May release my updated one in furture...


I have also made a new Modmail bot which does not require a database!
